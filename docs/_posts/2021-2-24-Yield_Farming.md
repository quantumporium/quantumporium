title: What is Yield Farming ?
---
Robert Kiyosaki, the legendary entrepreneur and the writer of the bestseller Rich Dad Poor Dad once says, "don’t work for the money, let the money work for you".
With the increase in popularity of cryptocurrency and the financial innovation that Decentralized finance applications are creating. I would like to update the quote and change it so it is a better representation of this new financial ecosystem that is making competition to the financial system we all know. 

In this new ecosystem, the quote will be more accurate as, __" Don’t work for the crypto, let the crypto work for you"__ .

One way that you can make this statement come true, is by taking part in the Yield Farming trend. With more than __1.9 billion__ in crypto put in yield farming platform, this new Defi trend can be considered as the biggest growth driver of the Defi ecosystem.

## But what is yield farming?

You can compare Yield farming as earning interest from a loan that you deposit in an interest-bearing account at your bank. The difference is that instead of deposing fiat currency in a centralized institution, you deposited cryptocurrency in a special kind of smart contract called a liquidity pool and ear more interest from it.
To make it simple, Yield Farming __consists of lending cryptocurrency in order to generate more cryptocurrency as a reward__. This reward is usually made with the interest rates that are paid by the borrowers.
Sometimes instead of receiving a fee as a reward liquidity provider can also earn tokens as a reward for providing liquidity. This practice is called __liquidity mining__.



## How it works with an example.
Let explain in more depth how Yield Farmers can earn reward from locking up their fun.
Lenders which are the yield farmer, also sometimes called liquidity providers, provide funds to Compound by adding a certain amount of cryptocurrency into Compound. Most of the time lenders use stable coins to do this action. 

Take for example a user named Bob. Bob decided he wanted to take part in the yield farming trend and decided to add 20 dollars worth of DAI in Compound.

> Compound is a Dapp build on the Ethereum blockchain that allows its user to take out loans or to give liquidity. Giving liquidity consist of stacking up cryptocurrency in a special type of smart contract called a liquidity pool you can compare liquidity pool as a digital dump for cryptocurrency.

After deposing his 20 :dollar: worth of DAI Bob will receive a cDai. CDai is a type of cToken which are a Compound native token. Compound use those tokens to tracked the supplied asset. To make it more clear tokens are used to track how much a giving user owns funds that are in Compound.
As soon that you deposited your 20 :dollar: worth of day in Compound and receive the cTokens that are equivalent to the amount you put in the liquidity pool you will begin to earn interest rates on your deposit. For example, bob will earn 7.05% APY on is DAI locked. 

> APY also know as annual percentage yield is what we use to measure the rate of return of your reward after taking into account compound interest. Compound interest is just interest that is earned on previous interest.

If you want to get your fund back and the reward you just need to redeem the cTokens that you earn when you put your fund in.
