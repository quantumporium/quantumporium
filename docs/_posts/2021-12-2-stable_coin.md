title: What are stable coin ?
---

__Stablecoins__ are the response to the question of  __how can we make cryptocurrency less volatile__.
In other words, stablecoins are cryptocurrencies made to __minimize the volatility of normal cryptocurrencies__ like bitcoin or ether.

To do so, Stablecoins prices and value are __backed by an outside asset that is more stable__. This outside asset can be a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar and even gold.
Stablecoins will also __create a "reserve" where the asset backing the Stablecoins will be securely stored__.


### Three types of stablecoins collateral.

As explained above Stablecoins are backed by collateral those collaterals can be diverse here are three of the most use.

* __Fiats__ are the most commonly used collateral for stable coins. The most popular fiat collateral is the U.S. dollar, but some companies are exploring other fiat collateral for stable coins.

* Other Stablecoins are tied to the value of __precious metals__ like gold.

* These are a more complex type of Stablecoins that __use other cryptocurrencies as collateral__ rather than fiat. Those special kinds of stable coins are engineered to track mainstream assets like a fiat currency.

### Some example of Stablecoins.

__Tether__ can be considered as one of the oldest stable coins. It was launched in 2014. Tether is pegged and used the U.S. dollar as collateral.


__Dai__ is a stable coin running on the MakerDao Dapp it is pegged to the U.S. dollar and is backed by ether.
Unlike most of the other stable coins Dais is __decentralized__ meaning there is no central authority trusted with the control of the system, rather __it uses smart contracts build on top of Ethereum to properly function__.


__USD coin__ is a stable coin that is backed by the U.S. dollar. It was created by __Coinbase__ one of the biggest bitcoin brokers and largest cryptocurrencies exchange.
