## About Me
Hi, I am Penyel Djegnene, a 17 y/o afro-Canadian currently based in Quebec.

Since I was a kid, I have always been passionate about innovation. It started in primary school science class and evolved throughout the year as I developed a passion for everything stem-oriented.

Now I am a young adult looking back at how far I've gone from asking my science teacher why the skies are blue to researching emerging technologies like blockchain, AI, quantum computing. 

I am currently using all those research to impact people and make the world a better place.


## Past Work and Experience
- I Created an educational piece of software that teaches you the basics of blockchain.
- I Wrote a multitude of articles about emerging technology.
- I created a decentralized donation application.
