## I'm currently working on and learning.

__Synthetic biology :dna::__ I have recently bought a synthetic biology and bioengineering class from [the-Odin](https://www.the-odin.com/)  this class will teach how to do bioengineering with CRISPR cas9.

__AI/ML :robot::__ I am learning and expanding the knowledge that I have on the field of AI. I am also researching some ethical and security problem that AI will bring in the coming years.

__Quantum programming <img src="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/qiskit.gif" width="15px" >:__ I am expending the knowledge I have on quantum programming by learning some of the underlying mathematical concept needed and learning Qiskit

__Blockchain__: I'm doing some research on blockchain technology more precisely cryptocurrency. I want to know how we can use concepts coming from the field of crypto-economics and microeconomics to create economic development.
